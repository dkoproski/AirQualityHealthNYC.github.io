<h1>Project Report</h1>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<div id="background" class="section level3">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Public health and overall community well-being are impacted by
environmental factors such as the concentration of air pollutants in an
area. While recent policy and public sentiment has lowered the emissions
of air pollutants in many urban environments, air pollution still poses
a threat to millions annually. This is especially true in urban
environments with large amounts of industry and vehicle emissions. New
York City is a great example of an urban setting where air pollution has
been <a
href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2022/earth-day-new-report-on-nyc-air-quality.page#:~:text=NYC%20Community%20Air%20Survey%20Findings%20Between%202009%20and%202020,ozone%20levels%20have%20remained%20stable.">decreasing</a>
over the past decade, but some regions still remain vulnerable. Thus,
more research is required to determine where future initiatives should
be targeted to best improve New York City air quality. This project aims
to review the geographic and temporal distribution of air pollutants to
determine if recent air pollution trends contribute to respiratory
related hospitalizations and to determine which regions are experiencing
the worst air pollution.</p>
<p>While there are countless air pollutants, key pollutants of public
health concern include: carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), and fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) <a
href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1">(WHO)</a>.
As a colorless and odorless gas, CO poses a great health risk when
inhaled in large amounts. Majority of CO levels are attributed to
machinery that use fossil fuels such as vehicles and gas space heaters
<a
href="https://www.epa.gov/co-pollution/basic-information-about-carbon-monoxide-co-outdoor-air-pollution">(EPA)</a>.
Some air pollutants, such as, ground-level ozone are created via a
chemical reaction between nitrogen oxides (NO_x), volatile organic
compounds (VOC), and sunlight <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution/ground-level-ozone-basics">(EPA)</a>.
During summer months O3 levels tend to peak due to regions with elevated
NOX emissions. Areas with high traffic levels, NO_x reacts to
ground-level O3 showing a reduction of O3 concentrations. Moreover,
areas such as city centers or areas with NO_x emission show lower O3
levels <a
href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/key-topics/airquality/nyccas/">(EHDP)</a>.
PM2.5, a prevalent air pollutant, originates from both outdoor and
indoor environments. Outdoor sources comprise of vehicle emissions, gas,
and fires, while indoor contributors encompass tobacco smoke, candle
combustion, and oil lamps <a
href="https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/indoors/air/pmq_a.htm">(NYSD)</a>.</p>
<p>Long term and short term exposure to the pollutants discussed above
is associated with a number of health concerns such as respiratory
diseases and heart attacks <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/air#:~:text=Air%20pollution%2C%20whether%20indoors%20or,respiratory%20symptoms%2C%20and%20premature%20mortality.">(EPA)</a>.
For example, high levels of O3 can pose a great risk with those
suffering from asthma <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution/ground-level-ozone-basics">(EPA)</a>.
According to the New York State Department of Heath, in-taking high
levels of PM2.5 can increase the risk for health problems <a
href="https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/indoors/air/pmq_a.htm">(NYSD)</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="motivation" class="section level3">
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The need for a comprehensive analysis and sustainable solutions for
the increase of air pollutants is needed. The motivation behind this
project stems from the potential effects pollutants may have on human
health. We aim to understand the association between air quality and
public health in New York City, to identify where interventions are
needed. ?? Remove maybe keep in intro??</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Initial Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are the air quality levels in New York City?</li>
<li>Which areas in New York City have more prominent air
pollutants?</li>
<li>How is air quality associated to the incidence of respiratory
diseases in an area?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Related Work</h3>
<p>In a study evaluating the potential decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions in relation to air quality and public health in NYC, the
suggested policy measures may result in an annual reduction of 160 to
390 deaths attributed to PM2.5. Neighborhoods characterized by higher
poverty levels showed a more pronounced health gain <a
href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c00694">Johnson, S.
2020</a>.</p>
<p>In a study focusing on PM2.5 levels, the potential health benefits
for adults and children were assessed. Outcomes such as preterm birth,
low birthweight, infant mortality, asthma incidence, hospital
admissions, emergency visits, and autism spectrum disorder were
considered. A estimated 23% improvement in PM2.5 was calculated, thus
leasing to avoided illness cases and death. Furthermore, for the period
2021-2025, the estimated associated economic benefit ranged from $31.8
billion and $77 billion <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120314523?via%3Dihub">Perera,
F. 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Ambient PM2.5 attributed deaths increased from 3.5 million in 1990 to
4.2 million in 2015. In 2015, the fifth-ranking cause of global deaths
was ambient PM2.5 <a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439030/">PM2.5
related deaths</a>. In a study following the PM2.5 concentration in NYC
from 2015-2020, similar decrease levels between January and May were
observed. There was less air pollutant in 2020 that could have been due
to the government shutdown during the corona virus pandemic could not be
confirmed<a

<h2><strong>Methods and Exploratory Analysis</strong></h2>
<div id="data-sources" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>The initial air quality dataset was obtained from <a
href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r">NYC
Open Data</a>, showing comprehensive information on air pollutants in
NYC from 2008 to 2021. The year range 2010 to 2021 was chosen for
analysis. A subsequent air quality data set was obtained from <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data">EPA</a>.
[add info about dataset]</p>
<p>The initial health data set obtained from <a
href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Emergency-Department-Visits-and-Admissions-for-Inf/2nwg-uqyg">NYC
OpenData</a>, specified emergency department visits, admissions and
visits related to influenza-like and/or pneumonia illness, categorized
by the modified ZIP code. A secondary disease data set from <a
href="https://a816-health.nyc.gov/hdi/epiquery/visualizations?PageType=ps&amp;PopulationSource=Syndromic">NYC
Health</a> detailed the number of hospitalizations attributed to asthma,
diarrhea, influenza-like illness, respiratory diseases, and vomiting for
each zip code. The data collection period occurred during 2016 to early
2023.</p>
<p>Additionally, a geographic location dataset was used to provide more
precise location data for observations in both air quality datasets.
These were used in the map making process as well as for statistical
analyses later.</p>
<p>?? add more here i think ??</p>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
<p>Two air quality and two disease data sets were obtained for analysis.
[AIR QUALITY (SEASONAL) ONE CLEANING]. [AIR QUALITY (DAILY)]. Two
disease data sets. [1] and [2]</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis-and-visualizations"
class="section level3">
<h3>Exploratory Analysis and Visualizations</h3>
<p>O3, PM2.5, and NO2 were the air pollutants chosen for our descriptive
and statistical analysis.</p>
<p>#histogram/boxplot seasonal air quality from 2009-2021 An interactive
histogram showing each air pollutant concentration overlaid by year,
from the years 2009-2021, was constructed to depict frequency
distribution and central tendency. Additionally, the spread, central
tendency, and presence of outliers were shown in an interactive box plot
based on air pollutant and year. PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations
continuously declined from 2009 to 2021, as evident on the layered
histogram and box plots. PM2.5 showed a steady decrease in
concentration, with the lowest median concentration exhibited in 2020.O3
concentrations initially increased from 2010 to 2016, but seemed to
stabilize around 30 ppb with observed measurement decreases from 2017 to
2021</p>
<p>#heatmaps of seasonal air quality from 2009-2021 A heat map of the
air pollutants with a year selector was constructed to monitor and
understand the air quality in NYC. High concentrations of the selected
pollutant were indicated by red and maroon, while lower concentrations
were shown in green. The heat map revealed distinct spatial and temporal
patterns of O3. Lower Manhattan showed a steady increase of O3 levels
from 2009 to 2021. Outer boroughs such as Brooklyn showed consistent
concentrations of O3 from 2009 to 2021.Comparing 2009 to 2021, the
levels in each area show a decline in PM2.5 levels. Additionally, the
layered PM2.5 map shows a greater amount of PM2.5 levels in lower
Manhattan throughout the years.NO2 also displayed a decrease in
concentration however it was less noticeable. O3 concentrations
displayed a different trend.</p>
<p>#time series daily counts air qual and daily of disease Time series
plot in regards to daily ER visit and disease counts were generated,
showing that asthma and respiratory diseases did not have a seasonal
pattern. However, pneumonia ER visits did peak during the winter months.
Similarly, time series plots were created for daily air concentrations.
Trend and seasonal patterns of CO, O3, and N02 showed oscillations
throughout the year. Specifically, O3 showed the a greater difference
and reached high levels during the summer month a opposed to NO2 which
peaked in the winter. PM2.4 should a steady concentration trend and did
not display seasonal patterns.</p>
<p>#boxplot of daily air pollutants by borough The frequency
distribution of daily air pollutant concentrations in regard to borough
was shown in boxplots. NO2 and PM2.5 showed consistent daily medians
throughout each borough. O3 showed a slightly elevated daily
concentration median in Staten Island compared to other boroughs.</p>
<p>#time series on daily air pollutant by neighborhood In the context of
these time series plots, the daily mean measurement of each pollutant,
categorized by neighborhoods, was derived and depicted as a distinctive
line. Coherent patterns were observed for each pollutant in these
neighborhoods. NO2 displayed its pinnacle reach during the winter and
spring transitions, where as O3 sowed its highest vales in the summer
months. These visual representation shows and highlights the nuanced
temporal fluctuation between the pollutants.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="statistical-results" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Statistical Results</strong></h2>
<p>Cross correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship
between O3 and pneumonia ER visits. From the cross-correlation plots,
the positive and negative correlations determined the lag between O3
levels and and pneumonia ER visits was about 117 days. The lag was added
as an additional predictor in the linear regression model.</p>

<h2><strong>Discussion and Conclusions</strong></h2>
<div id="findings" class="section level3">
<h3>Findings</h3>

<li>Are they what you expect?</li>
<li>What insights into the data can you make?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level3">
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Several challenges arose in the analysis related to data processing.
The datasets had significant constraints, including limited data,
temporal dimensions, and location misalignment. The limited data
potentially impacted our overall findings. The air quality datasets had
different observation frequencies, with one being seasonal and the other
daily. Health outcomes affected by air pollutants may be misrepresented
due to the lack of hospital information in areas of high pollutants.
Lastly, with only 3,000 observations available from an original data set
of 188,000 observations, there was a substantial reduction in sample
size data.</p>
