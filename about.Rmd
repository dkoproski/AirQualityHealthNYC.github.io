## Introduction 

Public health and overall community well-being are impacted by environmental factors such as the quantity of air pollutants in an area. Key pollutants of public health concern include: carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide(NO2), particulate matter (PM), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) [1](https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1). Air pollution is associated with a number of health concerns such as respiratory diseases and heart attacks [2](https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/air#:~:text=Air%20pollution%2C%20whether%20indoors%20or,respiratory%20symptoms%2C%20and%20premature%20mortality.). According to the New York State Department of Heath, in taking levels PM_2.5 can increase the risk for health problems [3](https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/indoors/air/pmq_a.htm). 

The need for a comprehensive analysis and sustainable solutions for the increase of air pollutants is needed. The motivation behind this project stems from the potential effects pollutants may have on human health. We aim to understand the association between air quality and public health in New York City, to identify where interventions are needed. 

Our initial questions included: What are the air quality levels in New York City?, Which areas in New York City have more prominent air pollutants? How is air quality associated to the incidence of respiratory diseases in an area?
