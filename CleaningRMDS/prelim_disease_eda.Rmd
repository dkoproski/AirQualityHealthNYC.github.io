unique(na_borough_disease1$zip_code)
```

Notes:

Zipcodes in second disease that were not included in merging bc no data for it in first disease

- 10271 (zero counts throughout all years) (299 rows)

- 10278 (zero counts throughout) (879 rows)

- 10279 (zero counts throughout) (124 rows)

- 10464 (some dates missing)

(Ended up keeping full joined data to preserve data, even though the majority that was in second but not in first had zeros for data. Additionally, keeping the NAs because don't want to alter to zeros because that may not be accurate data.)
