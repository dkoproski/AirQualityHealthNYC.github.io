## Introduction 

Public health and overall community well-being are impacted by environmental factors such as the quantity of air pollutants in an area. Key pollutants of public health concern include: carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide(NO2), particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1). 

As a colorless and odorless gas, CO poses a great health risk when inhaled in large amounts. Majority of CO levels are attributed to machinery that use fossil fuels such as vechiles and gas space heaters [EPA CO](https://www.epa.gov/co-pollution/basic-information-about-carbon-monoxide-co-outdoor-air-pollution). Some air pollutants, such as, ground-level ozone are created via a chemical reaction between nitrogen oxides (NO_x), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and sunlight [EPA O3](https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution/ground-level-ozone-basics). During summer months O3 levels tend to peak due to regions with elevated NOX emissions. Areas with high traffic levels, NO_x reacts to ground-level O3 to conclude a reduction of O3 concentrations. Moreover, areas such as city centers or areas with NO_x emission show a lower O3 levels [EHDP O3](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/key-topics/airquality/nyccas/). PM2.5, a prevalent air pollutant, originates from both outdoor and indoor environments. Outdoor sources comprise of vehicle emissions, gas, and fires, while indoor contributors encompass tobacco smoke, candle combustion, and oil lamps [NYSD PM2.5](https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/indoors/air/pmq_a.htm). SO2 in NYC is mainly generated through the combustion of residual fuel oil during the winter months from residential buildings. Additionally, SO2 contributed to PM2.5 formation in the atmosphere [EHDP SO2](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/key-topics/airquality/nyccas/) . 

Air pollution is associated with a number of health concerns such as respiratory diseases and heart attacks [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/air#:~:text=Air%20pollution%2C%20whether%20indoors%20or,respiratory%20symptoms%2C%20and%20premature%20mortality.). According to the New York State Department of Heath, in-taking levels PM_2.5 can increase the risk for health problems [NYSD Health](https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/indoors/air/pmq_a.htm). 

The need for a comprehensive analysis and sustainable solutions for the increase of air pollutants is needed. The motivation behind this project stems from the potential effects pollutants may have on human health. We aim to understand the association between air quality and public health in New York City, to identify where interventions are needed. 

Our initial questions included: What are the air quality levels in New York City?, Which areas in New York City have more prominent air pollutants? How is air quality associated to the incidence of respiratory diseases in an area?

## Methods 

Data: Source, scraping method, cleaning, etc.
The Air Quality data was obtained from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r), showing dataon various air pollutants throughout NYC from 2009 to 2021. 

Exploratory/Additional analysis: 
To explore the association between PM2.5 levels and time, a linear regression model was used. To monitor and understand the air quality from 2009 to 2021, a map of PM2.5 with a year selector was constructed. 

Visualizations: 
A heat map was constructed to enhance accessibility of ozone level data in the city from 2009 to 2021. 

## Results 

Exploratory/Additional analysis: 
PM2.5 levels continuously decline from 2009 to 2021, as evident on the layered PM2.5  map. Comparing 2009 to 2021, the levels in each area show a decline in PM2.5 levels. Additionally, the layered PM2.5 map shows a greater amount of PM2.5 levels in lower Manhattan throughout the years.

Ambient PM2.5 attributed deaths increased from 3.5 million in 1990 to 4.2 million in 2015. In 2015, the fifth-ranking cause of global deaths was ambient PM2.5 [PM2.5 related deaths](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439030/). In a study following the PM2.5 concentration in NYC from 2015-2020, similar decrease levels between January and May were observed. There was less air pollutant in 2020 that could have been due to the government shutdown during the corona virus pandemic could not be confirmed.
