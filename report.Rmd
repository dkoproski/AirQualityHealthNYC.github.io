# Project Report 
 
## **Introduction** 

### Background
Public health and overall community well-being are impacted by environmental factors such as the quantity of air pollutants in an area. Key pollutants of public health concern include: carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide(NO2), particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1). 

As a colorless and odorless gas, CO poses a great health risk when inhaled in large amounts. Majority of CO levels are attributed to machinery that use fossil fuels such as vechiles and gas space heaters [EPA CO](https://www.epa.gov/co-pollution/basic-information-about-carbon-monoxide-co-outdoor-air-pollution). Some air pollutants, such as, ground-level ozone are created via a chemical reaction between nitrogen oxides (NO_x), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and sunlight [EPA O3](https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution/ground-level-ozone-basics). During summer months O3 levels tend to peak due to regions with elevated NOX emissions. Areas with high traffic levels, NO_x reacts to ground-level O3 showing a reduction of O3 concentrations. Moreover, areas such as city centers or areas with NO_x emission show lower O3 levels [EHDP O3](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/key-topics/airquality/nyccas/). PM2.5, a prevalent air pollutant, originates from both outdoor and indoor environments. Outdoor sources comprise of vehicle emissions, gas, and fires, while indoor contributors encompass tobacco smoke, candle combustion, and oil lamps [NYSD PM2.5](https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/indoors/air/pmq_a.htm). SO2 in NYC is mainly generated through the combustion of residual fuel oil during the winter months from residential buildings. Additionally, SO2 contributed to PM2.5 formation in the atmosphere [EHDP SO2](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/key-topics/airquality/nyccas/) . 

Air pollution is associated with a number of health concerns such as respiratory diseases and heart attacks [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/air#:~:text=Air%20pollution%2C%20whether%20indoors%20or,respiratory%20symptoms%2C%20and%20premature%20mortality.). For example, high levels of O3 can pose a great risk with those suffering from asthma [EPA O3](https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution/ground-level-ozone-basics). According to the New York State Department of Heath, in-taking high levels of PM2.5 can increase the risk for health problems [NYSD Health](https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/indoors/air/pmq_a.htm). Exposure to SO2 can aggravate and worsen lung diseases which could lead to hospitalization and ER visits [EDHP SO2](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/key-topics/airquality/nyccas/). 

### Motivation 
The need for a comprehensive analysis and sustainable solutions for the increase of air pollutants is needed. The motivation behind this project stems from the potential effects pollutants may have on human health. We aim to understand the association between air quality and public health in New York City, to identify where interventions are needed. 

### Initial Questions
- What are the air quality levels in New York City?
- Which areas in New York City have more prominent air pollutants? 
- How is air quality associated to the incidence of respiratory diseases in an area?

## **Methods** 
### Data Sources
The initial air quality dataset was obtained from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r), showing comprehensive  information on air pollutants in NYC from 2008 to 2021. The year range 2010 to 2021 was chosen for analysis. A subsequent air quality data set was obtained from [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data). [add info about dataset]

The initial health data set was obtained from [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Emergency-Department-Visits-and-Admissions-for-Inf/2nwg-uqyg), specified emergency department visits, admissions and visits related to influenza-like and/or pneumonia illness, categorized by the modified ZIP code. A secondary disease data set from [NYC Health](https://a816-health.nyc.gov/hdi/epiquery/visualizations?PageType=ps&PopulationSource=Syndromic) detailed the number of hospitalizations attributed to asthma, diarrhea, influenza-like illness, respiratory diseases, and vomiting for each zip code. The data collection period occurred during 2016 to early 2023. 

Additionally, a geographic location dataset was used to .....



### Data Cleaning 


### Exploratory Analyis

An interactive histogram showing each air pollutant concentration overlaid by year was constructed to depict frequency distribution and central tendency. 
Additionally, the spread, central tendency, and presence of outliers were shown in an interactive box plot based on air pollutant and year. A heat map of O3, PM2.5, and NO2 with a year selector was constructed  to monitor and understand the air quality in NYC. High concentrations of the selected pollutant were indicated by red and maroon, while lower concentrations were shown in green.  



## **Results** 

PM2.5 levels continuously decline from 2009 to 2021, as evident on the layered PM2.5  map. Comparing 2009 to 2021, the levels in each area show a decline in PM2.5 levels. Additionally, the layered PM2.5 map shows a greater amount of PM2.5 levels in lower Manhattan throughout the years. 

The heat map revealed distinct spatial and temporal patterns of O3. Lower Manhattan showed a steady increase of O3 levels from 2009 to 2021. Outer boroughs such as Brooklyn showed consistent concentrations of O3 from 2009 to 2021.

Ambient PM2.5 attributed deaths increased from 3.5 million in 1990 to 4.2 million in 2015. In 2015, the fifth-ranking cause of global deaths was ambient PM2.5 [PM2.5 related deaths](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439030/). In a study following the PM2.5 concentration in NYC from 2015-2020, similar decrease levels between January and May were observed. There was less air pollutant in 2020 that could have been due to the government shutdown during the corona virus pandemic could not be confirmed.
