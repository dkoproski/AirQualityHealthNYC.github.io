<h1>Maps</h1>
<p>Visualizations of the geographic distribution of air pollutants will
help inform our later analyses by showing which locations/zip codes are
impacted the most by air pollution. Three air pollutants are mapped on
this page: Ozone (O3), PM2.5 (fine particles) and Nitrogen Dioxide
(NO2). Ozone and Nitrogen dioxide are measured in parts per billion
(PPB), while PM2.5 is measured in micrograms per meter cubed (<span
class="math inline">\(mcg/m^3\)</span>). While all years are not
examined later, data is mapped for all years for the sake of
completeness.</p>
<div id="ozone-levels-o3" class="section level2">
<h2>2009-2021: Ozone levels (O3)</h2>
<p>Based on the heatmap, it appears that ozone levels are generally at
their highest in Lower Manhattan, particularly in 2016 and 2019. High O3
levels are also seen in coastal areas such as Breezy Point (11697). This
makes sense since ozone forms at ground level when nitrogen oxides (such
as NO2) react with sunlight. There does not appear to be any trend in
ozone levels between 2009 and 2021 and levels seem to oscillate without
any pattern.</p>

<h2>2008-2021: Fine Particles PM2.5</h2>
<p>Similar to ozone, some of the highest levels of PM2.5 are seen in
Lower Manhattan. Unlike O3, however, PM2.5 concentrations generally look
to decrease from 2008-2021. This reflects similar trends seen in
previous EDA performed on the data. That being said, there is some
year-to-year variability and some clusters of zip codes exhibit high
levels as late as 2021.</p>
