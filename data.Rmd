## New York City Air Quality Dataset

Since October of 2014, the City of New York  hs actively maintained a dataset of up to date air quality information across most neighborhoods in the city. Accessible [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r), the raw data has measurements of certain air pollutants including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and fine particles (PM2.5). The dataset also contains some general information about vehicle traffic, air-pollutant related hospitalizations and more.
